 	<h1>My obsession with MOVIES</h1>
 	<p>We all know that watching movie is a great sector of entertainment. Like some other people, my obsession with movies started in my childhood. Being a kid I really enjoyed all the movements, characters, and cinematography of every movie. That time was really precious for me. I used to watch movies with my family members. It was like a small picnic for me.As time passed those became a memory and I can't seem to forget those joyous moments while watching movies. This is the main reason why I have become a movie maniac. But now I not only enjoy every movie but I try to learn something from each and every movie. Every movie has its own storyline and its own way to express that. Also, the relationship between each and every character also has something to say. Watching movies can be such a waste of time but despite all those disadvantages I try to learn something new from movies and try to become a better person. </p>
